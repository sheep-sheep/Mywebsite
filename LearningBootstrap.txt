1. Bootstrap is nothing but a CSS(cascading style sheet).
2. It provides the basic theme that you can add them to your page very quickly
3. It has the basic JS functions to do some anmimations or validations or checks.
4. You will still need to do coding if you want more customized functions.
5. It can't interact with Backend server


How does it intergrate with Django?
1. import the CSS file directly
2. there's a lib called Django-bootstrap? i will spend more time on that
