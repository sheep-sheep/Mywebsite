    Summary: Site admins usually place sites in /var/www/site.com and there may be sensitive data in /var/www that should not be made    available via a web server. All web servers on Debian have been updated to use /var/www/html as default instead of /var/www.

3. Below command allow you to write access to /var/www
    sudo chown -R www-data /var/www
    
4. permalinks-only-work-on-plain-setting/
    In case you are on Ubuntu, edit the file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf (here we have an example of /var/www):
    <Directory /var/www/>
            Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride None
            Require all granted
    </Directory>
