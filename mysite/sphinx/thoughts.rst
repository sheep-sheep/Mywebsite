Python - the Good, Bad and Ugly
===============================

Dynamic feature

For a shitty developers with sloppy code, this feature will bring distater to the whole team.

If the developer is writing Java, any mistakes or typos will be detected during the complier

state; however, these faults can never be found until the Dev or UAT stage!

I think the Peer Review and Testing environment is essentially important for a python-based project.

(Plus, UnitTesting is also important too, but few people are doing it.)
